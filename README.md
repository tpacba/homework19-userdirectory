## Description

The application is allows users to be able to view non-sensitive data at once, like an employee directory. The app uses React to break up the UI into components, to manage component state, and to respond to user events. 

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the app, a table of employees renders. The user is able to:

  * Sort the table by last name.

  * Filter the users by US state.

  * Search the users dynamically by name.
